title: A Very Young Robot Programmer
---

Some days ago we received one of these emails that help us keep on doing what we do. It was sent to us by the parents of Emily Ulloa, a 7 years old girl from Ecuador, who presented S4A at [BarCamp Ambato](https://barcampambato.org/) 2015, introducing herself as a robot programmer:

If you want to know more about her robots, you can check out this other video where she talks about *Dini Robotini*, a robot that can change its expression into different stages of sadness, happiness, surprise and other feelings by pressing some buttons, and that she envisioned can help autistic kids better express their emotions:

We want to encourage her to keep programming and being curious, the same way she encourages us to continue working on our projects!
