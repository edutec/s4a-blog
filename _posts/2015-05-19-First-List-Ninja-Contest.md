title: First List Ninja Contest
---

We are launching the first S4A/Snap4Arduino List Ninja Contest as an effort to help newcomers learn their way towards prototyping mastery while rewarding those who offer their knowledge and expertise to them.

## How do I participate?
Just register into our [Community Mail List](http://groups.google.com/group/s4a-community) and start helping other members. Point to useful information, offer advice on their projects, share your solution to their problems, help them get started, etc.

## What will I be earning?
The three most active users will be rewarded with three incremental prizes:

* **1st Prize:** [Electronics kit](http://s4a.cat/img/kit.png),  [3D-printed articulated servo support](http://s4a.cat/img/servos.png), [T-Shirt](http://s4a.cat/img/tshirts.png)\*
* **2nd Prize:** [3D-printed articulated servo support](http://s4a.cat/img/servos.png), [T-Shirt](http://s4a.cat/img/tshirts.png)\*
* **3rd Prize:** [T-Shirt](http://s4a.cat/img/tshirts.png)\*

## How will you choose the winners?
We will value not the amount of replies but also their quality.

## Does this mean you won't be offering you help anymore?
Not at all! We will continue to offer as much help as we can!

Our community mail list receives quite a lot of messages, and we try to reply to all of them, but we are a small and busy team and many of these questions end up unanswered. This contest is aimed at helping fill this gap and getting newcomers to feel supported by the community.

## What's the deadline?
We will be announcing the winners by the end of September, but we plan on launching similar contests often.

## Will you ship internationally?
Of course.

## What if a question is written in a language I don't speak?
Don't worry. We know this is an oddly multilingual list, which is why we will be looking at linguistic percentages when awarding the prizes.

## Is this aimed at S4A, Snap4Arduino, or both?
Both. Weird list. We know.
