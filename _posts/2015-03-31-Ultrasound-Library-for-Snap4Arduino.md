title: Ultrasound Library for Snap4Arduino
---

The next library is out, and this time allows you to control an ultrasound sensor like this one:

In this package you will find the modified Firmata you need to push to your board (UltrasoundFirmata.ino) and the blocks library for Snap4Arduino (Ultrasound-library.xml). Just _Fileâ†’Import_ it and you're done: [Ultrasound-Snap4Arduino.zip](http://vps34736.ovh.net/Ultrasound-Snap4Arduino.zip).

In the zip archive you'll also find an example for Snap4Arduino that graphically shows the distance between the sensor and an object:

Happy measuring!
