title: Snap4Arduino 1.0.6 beta
---

A long time has passed since the last post, and a lot has happened since then!

We officially presented Snap4Arduino at the [2015 European Scratch Conference in Amsterdam](http://scratch2015ams.org), along with some other projects ([Snapi!](http://snapi.citilab.eu) and [BeetleBlocks](http://beetleblocks.com)), and we've been trying to get this new release ready since then.

It's been once again thanks to [Ernesto Laval](http://github.com/elaval) that we've been able to do so, since we weren't able to compile the serial port plugin for Win32 and he managed in just an afternoon!

Long story short, here's what's new in this release:

* **Updated to latest nwjs.io version.** This should not affect you in any way, except because it made the following two improvements possible:
* **Updated to latest serial port plugins.** Now we can properly detect when the cable has been unplugged and, hopefully, some reported random disconnection problems on Win32 should now be fixed.
* **Latest Snap! codebase merged.** Now we benefit from the latest Snap*!* improvements, such as a freely resizeable Stage and a much faster user interface.
* **Cloud support.** This is a big one! Thanks to Jens MÃ¶nig you can now use your Snap*!* account in Snap4Arduino and save your projects to the Snap*!* cloud! No emailing XML files needed anymore. Coming soon is a way to share projects between users.

We're sorry about many contributions we have received that haven't been included in this release. We first needed to get these changes applied, and _now_ we have a clean base on which we can begin to add all of these improvements and bug fixes.

So, hopefully, we'll get yet another release soon!

Thank you all for your patience!
