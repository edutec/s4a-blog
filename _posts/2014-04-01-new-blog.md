title: S4A has a blog
---

Given the recent developments by the S4A team ([kits on the way](http://s4a.cat/#kit), [Snap4Arduino](http://s4a.cat/snap), and many other things we're slowly cooking), we've thought it a good idea to start a blog where we can share our findings and advancements with everybody.

We'd like to remind you we have a [community mail list](http://groups.google.com/group/s4a-community) where, as of today, 107 members share their doubts, experiences and suggestions.

That's all for now, stay tuned for news!
