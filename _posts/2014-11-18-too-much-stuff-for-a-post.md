title: Too much stuff for a single post
---

We haven't written in a long while, but that's because we're actually too busy working on several different projects and have literally no time left for writing.

To recap, during these months we've:

* **Released [Snap4Arduino](http://s4a.cat/snap) 1.0 beta**: With lots of bugfixes, new features and translations. As always, [Ernesto Laval](https://github.com/elaval) has been a priceless collaborator!
* **About to release [S4A](http://s4a.cat) 1.6**: The new version will feature a couple of new blocks (http and string manipulation), some bugfixes, a license correction and several new translations.
* **Beetleblocks**: [Bernat Romagosa](https://github.com/bromagosa) is working on this awesome 3D generative modelling project with [Jens Mönig](https://github.com/jmoenig), [Eric Rosenbaum](http://web.media.mit.edu/~ericr/) and [Duks Koschitz](https://architecture.mit.edu/student/duks-koschitz). The first public version will be out by the end of this year, but in the meantime let us share a spoiler with you: [Nautilius by Jens Mönig](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B1lJzXACYAEHxo7.png:large), and its [material print](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B1wBk-NIMAAJm-O.jpg).
* **Snappy**: Basically, API and big data programming for Snap<i>!</i>. JSON inspectors and libraries to deal with a couple of default APIs, plus new primitive blocks that allow you to build your own libraries. The first public version will also be out by the end of this year.

Besides all this, we've been building an activity database that aims to collect all of our teaching experiences in the last 7 years at Citilab. This project involves so much time and work that we're not sure when it will be finished, let alone translated into three languages, but we're confident we'll manage somehow, someday.

Stay tuned!
