title: New S4A release
---

It's finally out!

We've just published the [1.6 S4A release](http://s4a.cat).

Among other [changes](http://s4a.cat#changelog), you'll find most interesting the following ones:

* New translations (lots!)
* New HTTP block
* All motor pins can control both CR and 180ยบ servos
* Support for Leonardo boards

We want to thank the IMI (Informatics Metropolitan Institute of Barcelona) for having sponsored this version.

Please visit the [community mail list](http://groups.google.com/group/s4a-community) for more information and news!

Happy holidays (and happy prototyping) to everyone!
