title: Snap4Arduino 0.48 pre-alpha is out
---

This week we've had time to focus on [Snap4Arduino](http://s4a.cat/snap), which will be presented at [Scratch@MIT](http://scratch.mit.edu/conference) this summer, and thus has to look presentable!

Here's what has been fixed in this version:

- Arduino Mega is now *fully* supported. Meaning you can use all of its pins, both analog and digital

- Known bug causing number "0" to mysteriously disappear from dropdown list has been tracked down and hunted

Additionally, we have been working real hard to get the MacOSX version out soon, and we've done real progress. We have a prototypal version working in one of our iMacs here.

So, hopefully, a MacOSX working version will be released around next week. In the meantime, you know:
