title: Yet another Snap4Arduino release
---

This release, [Snap4Arduino](http://s4a.cat/snap) 1.0.4 beta, addresses an [issue](https://github.com/edutec/Snap4Arduino/issues/56) reported by [Valentina Chinnici](http://acrosseducation.tumblr.com/), which prevented users from accessing the Sounds, Costumes and Background libraries.

Thanks, Valentina!
