title: Bluetooth Car in Snap4Arduino
---

This weekend we've been invited to the [Maiker Faire Rome](http://www.makerfairerome.eu/) to give a workshop on [Snap4Arduino](http://s4a.cat/snap), in which we wanted to get the kids to play with robotic cars (both ours and their [MilkBots](http://www.raspibo.org/wiki/index.php?title=Milkbot)). Cables are really a nuissance when it comes to things with wheels, so we've been exploring how to connect the robots to some bluetooth modules we had laying around from an old project.

It wasn't hard to get it working, and we're really amazed how far the bluetooth signal reaches! We almost got the car outside the Citilab!

[Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FiSmQ-f3wEcA3MtlX67GMQiVmWQ-fFYuSLsNPFSfu1A/edit?usp=sharing) is only in Catalan, sorry about that! We'll translate when we've some more free time.
