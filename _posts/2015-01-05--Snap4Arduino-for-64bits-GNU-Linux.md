title: Snap4Arduino for 64b GNU/Linux
---

We love to receive contributions, especially if they allow new users to join our community. This time, thanks to [Frank Hunleth](https://github.com/fhunleth), we have a 64 bits GNU/Linux version available!

You can get it from our [official site](http://s4a.cat/snap/#download).

(And happy new year!)
