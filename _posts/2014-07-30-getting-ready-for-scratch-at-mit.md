title: Getting ready for Scratch@MIT
---

We'll be presenting [Snap4Arduino](http://s4a.cat/snap) at [Scratch@MIT](http://scratch.mit.edu/conference) this year, so we've been pushing hard to fix some annoying issues before going on holiday.

First of all, we have to thank [Ernesto Laval](https://github.com/elaval) for his great contribution to the project, as he's responsible for Snap4Arduino now fully working on MacOSX!

Additionally, we've fixed the following bugs and features:

- [Add dialog informing that a board has been connected](https://github.com/edutec/Snap4Arduino/issues/7)
- [Clicking twice on a "connect" block renders connecting impossible](https://github.com/edutec/Snap4Arduino/issues/6)
- ["Say" block inside a "forever" loop shows only first reading on GNU/Linux and MS-Windows](https://github.com/edutec/Snap4Arduino/issues/5)

You can head to [http://s4a.cat/snap](http://s4a.cat/snap) to fetch the new version for all three OSes.

Happy prototyping!
