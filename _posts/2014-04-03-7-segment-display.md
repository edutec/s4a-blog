There is a very particular citizen workgroup at [Citilab](http://citilab.eu) called [Nous Artesans](http://nartesanos.citilab.eu/) (New Artisans). It is a very heterogenous group, formed by people with very different backgrounds, ages and skills, but with a common interest in tinkering and building things.

Their latest workshop consists in building a miniature model of a Smart City, for which they needed to build a free parking spot counter, so we did that for them by using S4A:

All code and datasheets can be found inside [this package](http://edutec.citilab.eu/files/s4a-display.zip). Enjoy!
