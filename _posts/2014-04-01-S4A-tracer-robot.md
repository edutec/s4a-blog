title: A line tracer in S4A

Yesterday we built this cute (and super slow!) line tracer robot in S4A, as an example of what you'll be able to do with the [S4A Arduino Kits](http://s4a.cat/#kit):

The code can be downloaded from [here](vps34736.ovh.net/tracer.sb), and there's a lot of room for improvement, so you can enjoy extending it and trying to make it run faster!
