title: Tracing lines with Snap4Arduino
---

The next obvious example was to build exactly the same robot but on [Snap!](http://snap.berkeley.edu), and so we did:

The robot runs much faster because, in [Snap4Arduino](http://s4a.cat/snap), we can control the servo movement with much more precision. The step time for the servos in this demo is of 0.05 seconds, which is ten times shorter than what we could achieve with [S4A](http://s4a.cat).

You can get the code from here:
